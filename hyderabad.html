            <h2>Libraries in Hyderabad</h2>
            <p class="font">The State Central Library began in 1891 due to the efforts of Syed Hussain Bilgrami, whose personal library formed the institution's initial core.

                The library building has an area of 72,247 square yards and was built under the supervision of the architect, Aziz Ali. The foundation was laid in January 1932 by Prince Mir Osman Ali Khan. At the construction's completion, the Asafia Library shifted to the new building in 1936 to mark Nizam VII's Silver jubilee.
                
                In 1941, the Asafia State Library celebrated its Golden Jubilee. When the Hyderabad Public Libraries Act became law in 1955, Asafia State Library was declared as the State Central library for the Hyderabad State</p><br>
